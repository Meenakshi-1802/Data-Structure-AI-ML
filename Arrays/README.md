# 📘 Arrays ( NUMPY ----> arrays, indexing, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting )

# 🔹 What is an Array?  
- An **array** is a collection of elements stored in continuous memory locations.  
- Allows efficient storage, access, and manipulation of data using indexes.  
- Example: A list of marks, temperatures, or IDs.  

---

# 🔹 What is NumPy?  
- **NumPy (Numerical Python)** is a Python library for numerical and scientific computing.  
- Key features:  
  - Provides support for **multi-dimensional arrays (ndarrays)**  
  - Performs **mathematical operations** efficiently  
  - **Faster and more memory-efficient** than Python lists  

---

# 🔹 What is a NumPy Array?  
- A **NumPy array (ndarray)** is the core data structure of NumPy.  
- Similar to Python lists, but with important differences:  
  - Stores **homogeneous (same type) data**  
  - Supports **vectorized operations** (operations on entire arrays without loops)  
  - Can be **1D, 2D, or multi-dimensional**  
- Widely used in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**.

# 🔹 Key Operations to Know  
- **Indexing** → Access elements using their position.  
- **Slicing** → Extract sub-parts of an array.  
- **Reshaping** → Change the dimensions of an array without changing data.  
- **Broadcasting** → Perform operations on arrays of different shapes.  
- **Basic Math Functions** → Sum, Mean, Max, Min, etc.  

---

# 🔹 Why NumPy Arrays Are Important  
- Foundation for **data handling** in Python.  
- Used in **Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch** and many other libraries.  
- Makes large-scale numerical computations **fast and efficient**.  

---

# 📝 Important Points to Remember  
- NumPy arrays are **homogeneous** (all elements of the same type).  
- Much **faster than Python lists** due to optimized C backend.  
- Supports **multi-dimensional data** (matrices, tensors).  
- Essential for **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI** workflows.
