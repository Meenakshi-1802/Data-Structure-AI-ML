# ðŸ“˜ Data Structures for AI/ML & Data Science  

This repository contains all the **Data Structure concepts** that are essential in the field of **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science**.  
The goal of this repo is to provide a structured collection of core data structures, advanced structures, and domain-specific structures used in real-world AI/ML and Data Science applications.

## ðŸ“‚ Topics to be Covered  

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Basic Data Structures  
- Arrays (NumPy arrays, indexing, slicing, reshaping, broadcasting)  
- Lists (dynamic arrays, insertion, deletion, slicing)  
- Strings as Data Structures (tokenization, frequency counts, text processing)  
- Stack (LIFO operations: push, pop, peek)  
- Queue (FIFO, circular queue, double-ended queue)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Core Data Structures  
- Hash Maps (Python dictionaries, frequency counters, label encoding)  
- Linked List (singly and doubly linked lists)  
- Trees  
  - Binary Tree basics  
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)  
  - Introduction to Decision Trees in ML  
- Heap / Priority Queue (min-heap, max-heap, `heapq` usage in Python)  
- Graphs  
  - Representation: adjacency list, adjacency matrix  
  - Traversals: BFS, DFS  
  - Applications in ML & networks  

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Mathematical & Data Science Structures  
- Matrices (operations, multiplication, transpose using NumPy)  
- Sparse Matrices (SciPy CSR/CSC formats, usage in NLP: Bag of Words, TF-IDF)  
- Pandas DataFrame (indexing, grouping, merging, aggregation, handling missing values)  
- Multi-dimensional Arrays (higher-dimensional data for images, time series, tensors)  

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. AI/ML-Specific Data Structures  
- Tensors (PyTorch / TensorFlow basics: scalars, vectors, matrices, tensors, operations)  
- Trie (Prefix Tree, applications in NLP: autocomplete, spell check)  
- KD-Trees / Ball Trees (nearest neighbor search, applications in KNN, clustering)  
- Graph Data Structures in ML (using `networkx`, centrality, shortest path, community detection)  
- B-Trees (concept of B-Tree and B+ Tree, indexing in databases like MySQL)  

---

## âœ… Goal  
By the end, this repository will serve as a **complete reference for Data Structures in AI/ML and Data Science**, covering everything from basic foundations to advanced specialized structures used in modern applications.
